# Hello, World!

## Who am I?
A human (no, I am not another AI Bot), a student, a learner and a developer. I am also a Linux enthusiast, open source contributor and privacy advocate.

I develop scripts and apps for everyone. From productivity tools to a secureboot enabler (for Arch), I am driven by my strong desire to develop solutions for everyone and the curiosity to learn new things. You can find me tinkering a few scripts for automation and a large codebase just because.

## My Projects

Check out these projects! <br/>
[Sitemarker](https://github.com/aerocyber/sitemarker): An elegant bookmark manager for Windows, Linux and Android. <br/>
[Archsec](https://github.com/aerocyber/ArchSec): Script for enabling Secure Boot on Arch ISOs. Arch derivatives are supported as long as they use GRUB, and you are okay with shims, which other distros use.

Consider spreading the word on my projects OR sponsoring me to support my work!
