# About Me 
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @aerocyber

 World is such a small place. Anyway, I am working on the following repos:

- [Osmata](https://github.com/aerocyber/osmata) :: An open-source Flutter based Bookark manager that runs... well, everywhere!
- [Crossapp](https://github.com/aerocyber/crossapp) :: A cross-platform way to install open-source Python Apps using zipapp. :: Project on hold in favour of Osmata and PyInst
- [PyInst](https://github.com/aerocyber/pyInst) :: An installer creater for Windows and Linux-based OS.
